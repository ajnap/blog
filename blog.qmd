<h3>There Are Sprinkles Glued to My Custom Table</h3>
</div>
<p class="blog-excerpt">There are sprinkles glued on my custom built table for 14 because we love to do arts and crafts. There's old tape on my walls because we decorate with crepe paper for birthdays. Sometimes we need to realize that a messy life is proof that we tried, we created, we loved, we lived.</p>

<h3>"You're Missing Making a Memory"</h3>
</div>
<p class="blog-excerpt">Making lasagna when the spirit prompted me "you're missing making a memory." Calling to the children I said, "who wants to make lasagna?" Cheese and sauce and noodles flew everywhere. It was messy, it was a memory-making dinner.</p>

<h3>Why Do I Say Yes?</h3>
</div>
<p class="blog-excerpt">We have grated cheese in the fridge. Michael wanted to open a new cheese and grate it himself. Reason says no, but giving kids experience says yes. The beautiful tension between efficiency and growth.</p>

<h3>The Dirtier the Shirt, the Better</h3>

<h3>Being at the Crossroads</h3>
</div>
<p class="blog-excerpt">Being at the crossroads for my children has different meaning to me than 10 years ago. It used to be physically present, now it's mentally present — not on phone, emails, media. The evolution of intentional parenting.</p>
