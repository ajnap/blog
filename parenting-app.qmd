### Simple, Not Overwhelming
Parenting apps shouldn't add stress to your life. Ours will be clean, simple, and focused on what matters most.

::: {.philosophy-card}
<i class="fas fa-users"></i>

### Real Families, Real Life
Built by parents who understand that life with kids is messy, unpredictable, and absolutely beautiful.
:::

::: {.philosophy-card}
<i class="fas fa-clock"></i>

### Quality Over Quantity
We believe 5 minutes of presence is worth more than an hour of distraction. Every feature serves that goal.
:::

::: {.philosophy-card}
<i class="fas fa-smile"></i>

### Joy in the Journey
Parenting isn't about perfection—it's about connection, love, and finding joy in the beautiful chaos.
